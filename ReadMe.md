# To Run from the Command Line
Ensure that the `valohai-cli` package has been installed.
Use the `vh` command to run the desired 'step'. For example, for the `run_inference` step, you would use:
- `vh exec run run_inference --adhoc`

You can also specify a specific YAML file
- `vh exec run run_inference --adhoc --yaml valohai_app/valohai.yaml`
